# Backend Docs

## Backend Structure

We chose to use a very simple structure of having the main.py with the Dockerfile in root. And having the api points like /askchat under the routers folder. 

Since our backend depends on alot of 3rd party packages and isnt too big, it seemed sufficent enough to have it structured like this.
