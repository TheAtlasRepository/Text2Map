![Text2Map Project Architecture](./svgs/Text2Map%20Project%20Architecture.svg)

The system enables an intuitive workflow centered around the translation of user input into actionable geospatial queries and results. Text-based questions, data uploads, and chat-bot conversations are processed by the back-end, leveraging external APIs and advanced language modeling for context-aware analysis and the generation of informative map-based visualizations.

Depenencies: Currently the app relies on a custom built API point that that cna be found here: https://github.com/Eiriksb/GeoB-Rust-API. This will be developed on more after the bachelor so it is its own project.
