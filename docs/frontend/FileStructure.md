# Frontend Docs

## Frontend Structure

This follows a standard NextJS File Structure where tha pages are under the app sub folder and all it components are under the components folder under root. 

In here there are several different component types. Which are both Component, Functions, Types and UI. 

- /Component: Is where we store our whole pages or Components dependend on other parts of the Components to work.

- /Functions: This is where we store our components that do things with data or converters. Like APIUtils that talk too the backend and some Entity convereters.

- /Types: this is where we store our Types

- /UI: This is where we store our ui components lik singular Buttons, Cards, Forms and such.

We also store our Dockerfiles in the Root Folder.
